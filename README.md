# Dijkstra algorithm
A program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. It reads the values of the adjacency edges from the Excel file.

#File format
The program needs to fill in the data correctly in the excel file.
Example:![file format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75333054/160601093-3151fc8b-eecc-4334-8e97-a98bc9fd3298.png)
First string consists of all vertexes in graph.
You can also find an example file with the correct format in ```Tests/example.xlxs```.

#Working with the program
To find the shortest distance between two vertices, you need to specify the name and path to the Excel file, as well as the desired vertices.
